## About me

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 1.5em;">

<div style="flex: 1;">
I am an Assistant Researcher (Postdoc) at the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IMPAN), Warsaw, working in the Department of Mathematical Physics and Differential Geometry. I obtained my PhD at the [University of MÃ¼nster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/), Germany, under the supervision of Christoph BÃ¶hm. Previously, I obtained my Master's degree at the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA), Brazil, and my Bachelor's degree at the University of BrasÃ­lia (UnB), Brazil.

## Research interests
I am interested in differential geometry and geometric analysis, with a main focus on manifolds with symmetry. I have been especially interested in geometric flows with symmetry and moduli spaces of homogeneous Riemannian metrics under curvature conditions.
