## About me

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 1.5em;">

<div style="flex: 1;">
I am a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.impan.pl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IM PAN)</a>, working in the Department of Mathematical Physics and Differential Geometry. I obtained my PhD at the <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/MathematicsMuenster/aboutus/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Münster</a>, under the supervision of Christoph Böhm. Previously, I obtained my Master's degree at the <a href="https://impa.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA)</a>, Brazil, and my Bachelor's degree at the <a href="https://mat.unb.br/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Brasília</a>.     
<p>My full name is Roberto de Santana Araujo, but in academic contexts I typically go only by the surname Araujo</p>

## Research interests
I am interested in differential geometry and geometric analysis, with a main focus on manifolds with symmetry. I have been especially interested in geometric flows with symmetry and moduli spaces of homogeneous Riemannian metrics under curvature conditions.
