## About me

I am a Research Associate (Postdoc) in the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IMPAN), Warsaw, working in the Department of Mathematical Physics and Differential Geometry. I obtained my PhD at the University of MÃ¼nster, Germany, under the supervision of Christoph BÃ¶hm. Previously, I obtained my Master's degree at the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA), Brazil, and my Bachelor's degree at the University of BrasÃ­lia (UnB), Brazil.

## Research interests
I am interested in differential geometry and geometric analysis, with a main focus on manifolds with symmetry. I have been especially interested in geometric flows and special geometries with symmetry and moduli spaces of homogeneous Riemannian metrics under curvature conditions.
